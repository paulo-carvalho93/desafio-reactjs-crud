# React JS CRUD
React JS concepts challenge applied for the GoStack Bootcamp

## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, I will develop another application, GoRestaurante. Now I will practice what you I've learned so far in React.js together with TypeScript, practicing the concept of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

This will be an application that will connect to a fake API, and display the created food dishes and allow the creation, removal and updates of dishes.
